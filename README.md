# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

‚û° Problem Statement:
  Sometimes, Students struggle to balance their time and resources between different online courses and video lectures, potentially leading to burnout or incomplete learning experiences.

  
‚ùì Why is Timestamp Organizer useful?
  Timestamp Organizer helps students easily navigate and find information in online video lectures. It makes note-taking more efficient and effective.
  You can create well-organized, timestamped notes that make it easier to revisit and review the key information from online videos efficiently. This approach can significantly improve one‚Äôs retention and understanding of the material.

  
üíª Technologies Used:
  1) HTML
  2) JavaScript
  3) CSS
  4) React
  5) Semantic UI React

     
‚ú®Features of Timestamp Organizer:
  1)Organize: Create a heading for each section or topic you plan to take notes on. This will help you organize your notes and find them 
  quickly.
  
  2)Add Timestamps: As you watch the video, note down the relevant timestamp (e.g., 0:45) whenever the content shifts to a new topic or 
  when you find important information. This timestamp will serve as a reference point for that specific piece of information.
  
  3)Add links: Links to Important YouTube videos can be added to continue them from right where you left (Add the time up to which you 
  watched the video). Or mark an Important time stamp for highlighting purposes.
  
  4)Summarize Key Points: Under each timestamp, write a brief summary of the information covered during that time. Be concise and focus 
  on the most important points to make your notes more useful.
  
  5)Review Your Notes: Note important points with corresponding timestamps. Use timestamps to quickly find important information when 
  reviewing notes. This can be particularly helpful when preparing for exams or assignments.

  
‚ú®Features to be added in future:
  1)Tag Your Notes: Use tags or labels to categorize your notes by subject or topic. This makes it easier to find related information 
  when you have a large collection of notes.
  
  2) Highlight Key Information: Use formatting options like bold, italics, or highlighting to emphasize key points or concepts within      your notes.
  
  3) Include Visual Aids: If the video includes diagrams, charts, or visual aids, you can also describe them in your notes or include 
  screenshots for reference.

  4) Share and Collaborate: If you're studying with others, you can share your timestamped notes with them. Collaborative note-taking 
  can be a powerful way to fill in gaps and enhance comprehension.

  5) View and Edit buttons for each note.
